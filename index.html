        CSS developers are web professionals whose primary responsibility is to deliver a polished and styled product to
        the visitor’s browser. Practically every website uses CSS, but CSS is often not considered an “equal” in the
        modern
        web development stack. Unfortunately, this misperception can lead to CSS being taken for granted, or even
        overlooked
        to some extent.

          them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
